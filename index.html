        <h2>What is Photography?</h2>
        <p> According to Wikipedia, photography is the <strong>"art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as a photographic film"</strong>. 
            Sounds pretty technical huh? But if you ask me, I'll tell you that photgraphy is the ability to capture history, emotions, concepts, beauty and so much more in a single image. It is a way of touching, feeling and loving. What's captured on film is captured forever. Just think how wonderful that is!</p>
        <p>Photography is said to have beem around since the <em>5th Century B.C.E. </em>Try reading up on it to see how it has come to be since then. <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/brief-history-of-photography-2688527" target="_blank">Learn more.</a>
